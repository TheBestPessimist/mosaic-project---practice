		... use this piece of software?
		
		
Pretty simple: the TestClass in package main holds the main method.
Using it you can do wonderful things! (more or less related to this programs' scope.


This program is used to read the data from a json file, 
populate it's related beans accordingly and provide methods 
for calculating resource load and relocation cost.

The content of the packages otherClasses and allTasksVariablesComputator
contain the main classes while the packages Beans and fileIO
represent the dependencies.


PopulateBean is used to read the the json file 
located in the docs folder verify it's content and populate the class
GigaBean.
At the creation of a PopulateBean object, the content of the json is 
compared to the data found in the files all_tasks_variables.txt and 
single_task_variables.txt found in the docs folder. 

GigaBean is made of 2 other beans: FromMachineBean and ToMachineBean,
which contain information regarding the load state of a machine.


AllTasksVariablesComputator is used to compute different resource 
loads or relocation costs and implements iAllTasksVariablesComputator.
At instantiation, the constructor receives a Vector containing all 
the nodes created so far.
The objects returned in a MinMaxResource bean containing the ID of 
a node and the respective load/cost.


MakeJson is used to create a json object from a bean. (this is done pretty straight forward)
